The Universal Bot Mesh Toolkit is being developed with the concept to run on cross platforms: Windows,
MAC, Linux.

If you would like to run this program to see how it works for yourself, I have included the images and
placed them in a separate folder called "Images". You will also need to have Python 3 installed on your
computer.

Note: If you receive any "Module not found" error when attempting to run the program you may need to open 
an elevated command prompt (As Admistrator) and run the following commands:

1.) Pip install psutil
2.) Pip install pillow
3.) Pip install PySimpleGUI  (not needed)


Alternatively, you can download the executable titled "UBMT-Windows" to test the programs functionality.
This is a revised version that will only run on Windows platform. It is designed a little different but
still has the same concept. Just simply download the executable and double-click on it.
